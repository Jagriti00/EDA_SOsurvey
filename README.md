# EDA_SOsurvey
In this tutorial, we'll analyze the StackOverflow developer survey dataset. The dataset contains responses to an annual survey conducted by StackOverflow. I performed data cleaning, analysis and mainly visualize the data imported to gain insights on it. Python libraries I've used are Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Numpy.
